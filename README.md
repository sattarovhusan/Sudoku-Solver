# Sudoku-Solver

This is a sudoku solver that, given a valid board, finds a solution to it. To do this, it uses a backtracking algorithm. 
This project allowed me to learn a new library that I can use to create graphics for the future. It has also taught me 
about the nature of backtracking algorithms and how they are useful.

Some features of this project include:
1) Allows the user to use their mouse to click "Solve" to start the algorithm.
2) Shows a visualization of the process that the algorithm takes to solve the board.

This project was created using Python.
